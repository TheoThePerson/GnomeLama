    "description": "GnomeLama is a GNOME extension that integrates a powerful AI copilot directly into your desktop. It supports local AI chat functionalities through ollama (you can download ollama here: https://ollama.com/). This extension also works with an OpenAI API key to allow the use of ChatGPT. The extension allows you to chat, paste highlighted text with a middle click, and run bash commands easily. While the name GnomeLama suggests Llama models would be a good model to run with this, they have issues labelling the code properly and donâ€™t allow the running of commands. Instead, models like Qwen through Ollama or ChatGpt through the API provide better results.",
